//        | ReentrantLock                | A flexible lock with advanced features like interruptibility and fairness. |
//        | lock()                       | Acquires the lock, waits indefinitely.                                     |
//        | tryLock(timeout)             | Tries for a limited time; returns `false` if not acquired.                 |
//        | lockInterruptibly()          | Waits for the lock but can be interrupted while waiting.                   |
//        | finally { lock.unlock(); }   | Always used to release the lock to prevent deadlocks.                      |
//        | Thread.sleep()               | Simulates delay, here acting as the transaction time.                      |
